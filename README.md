## interactive mitigation planner
i really hate trying to plan mitigation in those mitigation spreadsheets that get put on reddit bc you have to, like, actually do math. so, fuck that- ive made an unga bunga planner where you move your blocks around & it spits out mitigation %s/shows you when you can hit your buttons again.

what this thing can do:
    - drag & drop skills onto the timeline, shows their effective duration & cooldown
    - cooldowns are enforced so you can't "use" a skill again until it's off cooldown
    - hover over an attack in the fight timeline to see the mitigation active when it goes out
    - enable party view to show 8 people with their own skills/timelines, click each party member then hover over fight timeline events to see mit on them specifically
    - change party member jobs & fight timeline


what it can't do yet but hopefully will soon:
    - actually have all the relevant actions for each job & complete fight timelines
    - show shields, e.g. shake it off
    - allow single-target skills to be put on other people, e.g. tbn, intervention
    - filter skills by level for old ultimates (or old savages for MINE gamers)


aspirational goals
    - fight timeline filters to hide non-damaging and/or avoidable attacks
    - account for charges, e.g. oblation
    - assign names to party members
    - import/export functionality


what it will probably never do:
    - check for conflicting/non-stacking skills, e.g. using two reprisals at once, using troubadour and shield samba even though they don't stack. just dont be a dummy 4head
